**OVERVIEW** <br>
I understood that the problem at hand is the inefficient management of leads at HSR Motors. Currently, they are using spreadsheets to manage leads, which doesnâ€™t allow real-time collaboration, and lacks features such as lead status tracking and easy assignment of tasks. The goal was to create a web application that can:
Manage leads effectively by categorizing them into different statuses (New, Contacted, Not Interested).
Allow real-time collaboration, where the sales team can update lead statuses and assign tasks.
Provide the business manager with a dashboard to analyze and visualize lead data for better decision-making.
To solve this problem, I approached the design of a flexible, user-friendly web interface with a clear and intuitive layout. The application uses a responsive design to ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile devices, with key features such as:
Lead Listing
Lead Management (Kanban-style view)
Dashboard for data visualization
<br> <br>
**FEATURES**<br>
**Lead Listing** <br>
Allows users to view a list of all leads with essential information like name, contact info, source, status, and assigned sales personnel.
Includes filtering and sorting options to manage large datasets.<br>
**Lead Details** <br>

**Lead Management** (Kanban-style View) <br>
A visual board displaying leads in different status categories (New, Contacted, Not Interested), allowing users to drag-and-drop leads between columns to update their status.Provides a quick overview of the current lead status distribution.<br>
**Dashboard**<br>
Displays data visualization in the form of charts to show the lead status distribution, helping the business manager to analyze lead data and make informed decisions.Interactive graphs that update dynamically as lead data changes.
